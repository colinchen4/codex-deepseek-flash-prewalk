# codex-deepseek-flash-prewalk

Two [Codex skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) that run an orchestrated coding handoff:

**SOL (your main Codex model) → prewalk + first credible edit → DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (`deepseek-flash`, max reasoning) executes → SOL reviews the actual diff.**

- `prewalk/` — the orchestration skill: SOL investigation, confidence gate, one atomic edit, dispatch, and final review.
- `codex-deepseek-subagent/` — the management skill that owns the DeepSeek executor surface: provider config, merged model catalog, credential storage, desktop runtime staging, and acceptance tests.

## Why not `spawn_agent(agent_type="DeepSeek")`

On desktop/CLI builds ≥ 0.146 the collaboration namespace is gated to the ChatGPT backend: a spawned subagent is pinned to the `openai` provider and a non-OpenAI model fails with `The 'deepseek-flash' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account.` The older `multi_agent_version: "v1"` catalog override no longer helps (worked around 0.144, dead by 0.146). See [openai/codex#31882](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/31882) and [openai/codex#36957](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/36957).

So the executor boundary here is a **managed `codex exec` child process**:

```sh
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -s workspace-write -C "<workspace>" \
  -m deepseek-flash -c model_provider="deepseek" -c model_reasoning_effort="max" - < "<handoff-package>"
```

This only relies on the top-level `model_provider` override and never touches the collab namespace, so it keeps working across the versions where native dispatch is backend-gated. Sandboxed (`workspace-write`) execution requires the staged runtime to include four sibling files — `codex.exe`, `codex-code-mode-host.exe`, `codex-windows-sandbox-setup.exe`, and `codex-command-runner.exe`; the last one actually launches sandboxed commands, and a staged copy missing it fails every command with `CreateProcessWithLogonW failed: 2` regardless of path shape. See [references/compatibility.md](codex-deepseek-subagent/references/compatibility.md) for the full findings; the work-chain acceptance in `test`/`repair` covers exactly this chain.

## Requirements

- Codex desktop app (Windows or macOS), started at least once
- Python 3.11+ (on Windows the desktop runtime's Python 3.12 works)
- A DeepSeek API key (`sk-...`) — stored in the OS credential vault, never in config files

## Install

Copy both skill directories into your Codex skills location:

- Global: `~/.codex/skills/`
- Or project-only: `<project>/.agents/skills/`

## Setup

1. In Codex, ask: `配置 DeepSeek 执行器` — the management skill runs `setup`, asks for your API key via stdin, writes the `[model_providers.deepseek]` block, the merged model catalog, and stages the desktop runtime.
2. It then runs acceptance: a direct DeepSeek call plus the executor-surface pass phrase (`NATIVE_DEEPSEEK_OK`). Status `ready` means the executor boundary works.
3. After changing the parent model, run `repair` to re-apply and re-verify.

## Usage

Ask in plain language, e.g.:

```
[$prewalk] 把这三个批改问题修掉，测试由默认模型进行
```

SOL runs the prewalk and lands one edit, dispatches the handoff package to the DeepSeek executor process, waits, then reviews the real worktree diff before reporting.

## Notes

- Do **not** pick `deepseek-flash` in the desktop model picker: the app persists that choice into the top-level `model` in `config.toml`, which breaks the non-DeepSeek parent contract this setup relies on.
- The API key lives in the OS credential vault (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain) under the target `codex-deepseek-api-key`; no secret is ever written to the repository, config, or logs.
